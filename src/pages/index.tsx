    <h3>I build applications for the web</h3>
    <p>
      I&apos;m a Front End Engineer based in Berlin.
      <br />I write clean, elegant and efficient code.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current weapon of choice is <em>React</em> and related ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a profound understanding of <em>Component Driven Architecture </em>
      with the proper separation of concerns in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&apos;m strong proponent of open web standards, thus my current
      autodidactic interests are targeted at Web Components (html template,
      custom element, shadow DOM)
    </p>
    <p>
      I perform at my best when I have sense of ownership over my work and my
      teammates share similar enthusiasm with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I care about technical standards and prefer well thought comprehensive
      solutions over so called temporary hacks
    </p>
    <p>
      In currently very complicated world of many technologies in hand i try to
      implement new motto <strong>Good Enough</strong>!
