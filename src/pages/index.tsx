    <h2>Hello! 👋🏻 I'm Miłosz Frejnik</h2>
    <h3>I build applications for the web</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a frontend engineer based in Berlin.<br />
      I write clean, elegant and efficient code.
    </p>
    <p>My current weapon of choice is React and related ecosystem.</p>
    <p>I'm strong proponent of open web standards, thus my current autodidactic interests are targeted at Web Components (html template, custom element, shadow DOM)</p>
    <p>I perform at my best when I have sense of ownership over my work and my teammates share such enthusiasm with me.</p>
    <p>I care about technical standards and prefer well thought comprehensive solutions over so called temporary hacks</p>
